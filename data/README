# Data for the paper.

Note:  

EvoStats_final2.txt has the same data as Supplementary Table 3 of the paper.

FUNCTIONAL_CATEGORIES.txt contains enriched functional categories (shown in Figure 2A).

Correlation_OutofSampleR2_EvoRate.txt contains the correlation between evolutionary rate and out-of-sample imputation R2 for gene expression. The out-of-sample R2 assumes local predictors and is derived from 10-fold cross validation within the PrediXcan framework applied to GTEx data. For a wide range of tissues, out-of-sample imputation accuracy is significantly correlated with evolutionary rate. In particular, this suggests that transcriptome-wide association analyses using local predictors in a range of tissues have significantly less power to detect disease associations for conserved genes than for fast-evolving genes.
